# PHP CRUD REST API

## Project Description

This project is a simple PHP-based REST API created for learning purposes. It demonstrates how to implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using PHP and MySQL. The API allows you to interact with data (e.g., user records) through standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

This project also comes with a Docker setup to simplify the development environment and make it easier to run the project in different environments.

## Features

-   **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete resources via API
    endpoints.
-   **MySQL Database**: Data stored in a MySQL database.
-   **Dockerized**: Simplified setup using Docker.

## Technologies

-   PHP
-   MySQL
-   Docker

## Installation

        docker-compose up 

-   **Stop the containers:**

        docker-compose down

## Conclusion

This project is intended to help you learn the fundamentals of building a RESTful API with PHP and MySQL. You can modify and expand the codebase as needed, adding additional features such as user authentication, more advanced queries, or integrating with frontend applications.

Feel free to explore and modify the project as you continue to learn.
